# Library
A virtual bookshelf where user can add books by title, author, color and number
of pages.

# Description
A browser program that emulates a single bookshelf. Books can be added
individually taking the book's title, author, page count, text color and cover
color as inputs.

The higher the page count the thicker the book will
appear on the shelf. Once the shelf is full, no further books can be added until
the shelf is cleared.

# Instructons
The shelf comes pre-populated with several books. The red '*Clear Shelf*' button in the top
left of the screen can be used to clear all books from the shelf. 

When the '*Add Book*' button is pushed a '*Add a Book:*' popup is displayed: 
- The '*X*' button in the top right closes the popup and clears all forms.
- User can input the *title* and *author* of their book in their respective fields.
- The number of pages entered will determine how wide the book appears on the
  shelf. A book can be no longer than 2000 pages.
- Color pickers for the book cover and text color can be used to alter the color
  scheme of the book.
- The blue '*ADD*' button can be pressed and the book will appear on the shelf.
  All fields must be filled in order for the book to be submitted.

No further books can be added if the shelf becomes full. The shelf will have to
be cleared using the 'Clear Shelf' button before another book can be added.

# Installation/Run
Countdown can be run from https://eugene-l-h.github.io/Library/ or by
downloading the files and opening the index.html file in the browser of your
choice. 

This project was developed and tested in Google Chrome on screen resolutions of
1920x1080 and 1366x768. 

Library scales to mobile devices but is best experienced on desktop.

# Notes
This project made start thinking about how important mobile-first design can be.

I built Library as a desktop app first. At about the midpoint of the project I
decided it should be able to scale to mobile devices. I found it quite
challenging scaling the project down as opposed to how much easier I think it
would've been to scale up from mobile to desktop.

I now tend to focus on a more mobile first design.
